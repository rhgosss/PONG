**#Pong Game â€“ Digital Systems Project**
This project was developed as part of the Digital Systems course by me and my classmate. We implemented the classic Pong game, focusing on digital logic design and hardware efficiency.

Throughout the project, we followed a structured development process over several weeks. Each phase of the project is documented in our weekly presentations, where the steps and progress are detailed. Additionally, demonstration videos are included to showcase the full functionality of the game.

One of the highlights of our implementation is that we achieved the required logic using the minimum number of integrated circuits, which demonstrates both optimization and a deep understanding of digital design principles. Our efficient and functional design earned us top marks in the course.
